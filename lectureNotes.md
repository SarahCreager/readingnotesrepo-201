## what is Data Type?

  - A type of data
  - A way of passing data information that a computer can understand or try to guess whether is a string type or numeric type.

  Javascript is a **losly typed** *Dynamic language. 

    - With Javascript you do not need to define the type of declaring a varible
    -  you can change the data type after it has been initially defined.


  ## Primitives
    They are data type that can not be broken down into something more basic.

    - Number Data Type = Numeric, include decimals and negative 

    - Boolean Data Type = true/false. this data type is the logical datatype

    -  String Data Type = a string of characters used to indicate texts.
    - undefined Data Type = datatype which value has not been defined, and as a result you will get an undefined 
    - Null = assigns a non value which returns an object datatype

    ## Conditional Statement
    conditional statement tell a computer **WHAT TO DO** *if a certain condition is true or if a certain condition is false it tells the computer to do a different thing*

    **Else IF**  If both of the first conditions are false then the program goes on to the *ELSE*
