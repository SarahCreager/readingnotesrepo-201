# Code Reviews 

We reviewd as a class Joe's JavaScript assignment. we touched little bit on the difference betweeen Var and Let. An opportunity to do research.

# Falsy Values in JS
  - False
  - 0 (Zero)
  "empty string"
  - null
  - undefined
  - NaN

# Comparison Operators
  |a==b| it means closely equal or losely equal
  |a===b| strictly equal, the value and data are exactly equal
  |a != b| not equal to 
  |a !== b| strictly not equal, if either is false this true
  |a>b| greater than
  |a < b| less than
  |a>=b| greater than or equal to
  |a<=b| less than or equal to
  a && b = both a and b evaluate truthy
  a || b = if teither evaluate truthy this is truthy
  !a = not opposite, = the opposite of the previous.

one things about this logical operators is that it reads left to right
basically if it finds truth in the left operator it won't go to the right.

# Arrays
  - a datatype of object
  - a list of element, can be any datatype
  - every element in an array has an index location (reference location) where it can be found in the array
  - JS arrays are zero based = the first value starts with zero
  -  In JAVASCRIPT arrays can be mixed datatypes but not happily looked upon


# Loops ( the best )

    **Why do we use LOOP?**
        save us from repeating code  and allow ambiguity of # of times
